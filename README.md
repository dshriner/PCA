# PCA
Response to Elhaik (PMID 36038559)
The document PCA.pdf is a rendered R markdown file reworking the toy model from Elhaik's 2022 Scientific Reports publication "Principal Components Analyses (PCA)-based findings in population genetic studies are highly biased and must be reevaluated." The MATLAB code from Figure 1 is reproduced and ported to R. The R code separates decorrelation accomplished by eigendecomposition from dimension reduction.
